# PortfolioWebsite

A simple static website that showcases the work that I've done throughout my career.

This website is going to constantly be updated throughout my career.

A single page with a vertical layout where users can seamlessly look at the necessary information by scrolling up or down.

Version 1 of the website has been deployed to Heroku but improvements still need to be made.

This is the link of the website: https://eduardodotel.herokuapp.com/
